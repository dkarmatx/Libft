Libft - recreating of the C standart library

## Memory editing functions

#### void			\*ft_memcpy(void \*dst, const void \*src, size_t n);
The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dst.  If dst and src overlap, behavior is undefined.  Applications in which dst and src might overlap should use memmove(3) instead.
